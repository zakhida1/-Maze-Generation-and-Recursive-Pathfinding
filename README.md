 #Explanation:

 The objective of this project is to generate a maze and find a valid path from  start point to an exit using recursion.This task involves:
1)Maze Generation:Creating a random maze where each cell is either a wall or a path using the recursive backtracking algorithm

2)Pathfinding:Using recursion to find a path from the start point to the exit implementing a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach

3)User Input and Output:Allowing the user to specify the maze size and display the generated maze and its solution

##GitHub Structure:

Initial Commit:Setting up the project and creating a README file

Maze Generation:Adding the recursive backtracking algorithm to generate a random maze.

Pathfinding:Implementing the recursive DFS algorithm to find a path through the maze

Display Function: Implementing a function to print the maze and the solution

Refactoring: Ensuring the code is modular with separate methods for generating the maze  solving it   and displaying results

Final Commit:Debugging and cleaning up the code for clarity and performance

##Project Documentation:

Maze Generation:The maze is created using a recursive backtracking algorithm.this ensures that the maze is always solvable by randomly choosing paths and backtracking if a dead-end is encountered

Pathfinding:The DFS algorithm explores the maze recursively.It tries moving in all four directions (up, down, left, right) and backtracks when no valid path is found

Input-Output: The program is hardcoded for a 10x10 maze but you could extend it to accept user input for dimensions and start-exit points.The maze and the solution path are displayed in the console

Efficiency:While not the most optimal algorithm the solution works efficiently for small to medium maze sizes (10x10)
